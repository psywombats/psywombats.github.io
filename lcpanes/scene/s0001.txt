[title Intro]

Ready?

It's dark, but it isn't nighttime. But if it isn't nighttime, why are you lying down? And why is this thing you're lying on so cold? It's a stone floor.

Sitting up brings nausea, but your surroundings come into focus. The room is very small, barely more than a prison cell. A single light bulb is the only source of illumination. The walls are untouched gray concrete, as is the ceiling.

Furnishing is minimal. At one corner of the room is a writing desk with the usual assortment of encyclopedias, journals, notebooks, pens, and loose-leaf paper. A table at the far side of the room holds a very old computer, and a mattress sits at the opposite corner. Two large, metal doors are positioned on the left and forward walls, while a wooden one with no doorknob is behind you. Apart from that, there is nothing of interest aside from a drain you are sitting on.

You rise. You stretch. But still, you have no idea how you got here, no idea where this is, and no idea how to leave. What will you do?
