[title Check Back In]

[type LCPANES 0] sorry Cecilia, no luck
[type LCPANES 0] seems I can't get anywhere on any of this
[type LCPANES 0] wish Elyse left clearer instructions on what exactly I'm supposed to do

Is there anything more to say? But before you can decide, something else shows up on the screen.

[type AVBRANDY 0] yo, hey, major breakthrough
[type AVBRANDY 0] i finally cracked it
[type AVBRANDY 0] a whole other codebook is down
[type AVBRANDY 0] i know it must be getting close to night, so i just need to give this to someone fast
[type AVBRANDY 0] pass these codes on to licozy, he'll know what to do
[type AVBRANDY 0] ZJJXKK ZCVJL ZJV
[type AVBRANDY 0] actually never mind, i'll give them to cecilia, she's further along in the chain
[type AVBRANDY 0] and i've also got some stuff for you too
[type AVBRANDY 0] just type it in on the screen where you normally send messages to me
[type AVBRANDY 0] i've already used mine so i'm in direct touch with cecilia
[type AVBRANDY 0] use yours however you want
[type AVBRANDY 0] ready?
[type AVBRANDY 0] ACLIBR
[type AVBRANDY 0] i know it's short, but just do it
[type AVBRANDY 0] it opens coms with one other terminal
[type AVBRANDY 0] hang on, cecilia wants something
[type AVBRANDY 0] go use that code

Well, what else can you do? ...What should this do again?

[type LCPANES 0] ACLIBR

Then something strange happens...

[type 00000000 0] NICE WORK.
[type 00000000 0] I SEE YOU'VE DISCOVERED THE VALUE OF COOPERATION.
[type 00000000 0] SO LET ME LET YOU COOPERATE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.
[type 00000000 0] PICK A TERMINAL.
