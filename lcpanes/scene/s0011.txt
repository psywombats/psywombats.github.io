[title Stock Futures]

The front of this book promises a comprehensive detail of trends, statistics, and insights into futures market growth, but the pages won't open. Is it glued shut? No, it's one of the book-safe objects. Of course, make the book so boring that no one would take it off the shelf. Along the side of the book is a small rotary lock with four digits. Without the combination, it won't open. You could try a number or go [b]ack.
