[title The Bookshelf]

All the covers are cracked and worn, and most are dusty. There's a bit of a selection... You could check the [A]rborist's Guide to North American Trees, a [K]ing James bible, the [U]nabridged Short Stories of Chekhov, the [W]orld Encyclopedia 1954 Edition, or the [S]tock Futures and Analysis Record 1960-1970. Or just head [b]ack.
