[Torn Looseleaf]

Most of these pieces of paper have strange characters written on them in purple pen. Some are blank and some are riddled with odd pictorial characters. Each one looks like some variant of a Roman character, but nothing seems to be an exact match. It goes on for pages and pages... There are numbers at the top, but nothing is in order, and half the pages are torn.
