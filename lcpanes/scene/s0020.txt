[title Medicine Cabinet]

A fair-sized cabinet with glass doors hangs above the sink. The frame is old and wooden, not an antique style of wood, more of a cheap apartment style of wood. There is a chain and padlock around the two little knobs that serve as door handles, so at the moment it can't be opened.

The contents are about two dozen glass vials and old beakers, each filled with a tablet or capsule or clear liquid. A few of them have strips of scotch tape affixed to them, but any markings that existed have bled off from moisture.
